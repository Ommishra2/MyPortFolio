- Primary color: Soft blue (#64B5F6) to convey trust, professionalism, and approachability. 
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF) to create a clean and calming backdrop that allows the portfolio content to stand out. 
- Accent color: Light orange (#FFCC80) to draw attention to key interactive elements and calls to action without overpowering the overall aesthetic.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif known for its modern and neutral appearance, well-suited for both headlines and body text.
- Minimalist icons that are clean, geometric, and consistently styled to represent skills and project categories.
- Grid-based layout that ensures a clean, organized, and responsive design across all devices.
- Subtle, non-intrusive transitions and animations to enhance user experience and provide visual feedback without distracting from the content.
